	               <p>Rockport Software participated in a winning consortium working on a project under Innovate UK's Future Flight Challenge. 
	               The consortium, led by Heathrow Airport, included operational experts from airports, airlines and air traffic management, as well as technology and academic organisations. 
	               The Fly2Plan project was designed to innovate and support the emerging information exchange requirements for an airspace environment where new modes of air travel, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, are to be operated in increasing numbers. </p>

	               <p>June 2022 news update: Cranfield University published a white paper based on work undertaken during the Fly 2 Plan project.

                    <p> 
                    Fly2Plan is one of the projects under <a href="https://www.ukri.org/our-work/our-main-funds/industrial-strategy-challenge-fund/future-of-mobility/future-flight-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Innovate UK's 
                    Future Flight Challenge</a>, an R&amp;D programme aiming to develop greener ways to fly, to encourage development of new modes of air travel and to support the airspace and aviation systems of the future. 
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                    The UK airspace will look very different in the coming years, as new airborne vehicles are deployed, including unmanned aerial vehicles, flying taxis and delivery drones.  
                    Air Traffic Management of this future airspace will rely on the efficient exchange of information between a more diverse range of organisations than at present and will require new models of trust to secure and authenticate that information. 
                    The volume and complexity of flight information produced and exchanged by the aviation industry will rise dramatically as the utilisation of the future airspace increases.  
                    Meaningful information exchange, based on international standards such as the <a href="https://acris.aero" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACRIS Semantic Model</a> and the ICAO SWIM Concept, will be crucial for the safety, security and efficiency of airborne operations. 
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                    The Fly2Plan project, awarded to our consortium in November 2020, looks to support such information exchange requirements by building a blockchain-based system 
                    to facilitate the trusted exchange of aviation information in a secure and scalable manner. 
                    The distributed model of trust and data quality assurance provided by distributed ledger technologies are necessary for the safety critical airspace environment.
                    The Airports Council International (ACI) <a href="https://acris.aero" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACRIS Semantic Model</a> provides a consistent and integrated view of airports and the wider aviation ecosystem. 
                    The ACRIS Semantic Model also facilitates the rapid prototyping and deployment of systems and applications to support the demanding requirements of current and future airspace users.

                    <p>The Fly 2 Plan project recognizes the need to develop an information model to support the exchange of information between ATM and UTM stakeholders. 
                       As an international standard used by airports and aviation stakeholders across the world, the <a href="https://acris.aero" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACRIS Semantic Model</a> was chosen as the basis of this new Fly 2 Plan information model. 
                    </p>
					
                    <p>During the Fly 2 Plan project, Rockport Software has provided significant information modelling expertise: </p>
                    <ul class="text-left">
                        <li>Information Model: developed a new information model, based on, and extending, the <a href="https://acris.aero" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACRIS Semantic Model</a> to cater for the specific requirements of Fly 2 Plan </li>
                        <li>Use case modelling: using the project use cases and stakeholder interviews, developed the conceptual model, including alignment and clarification of terms used in each of the ATM and UTM domains.</li>
                        <li>Standards analysis: developed the information model to ensure alignment and compatibility with existing aviation information models (such as AIDM, AIRM) and message exchange standards, such as those defined by IATA and ICAO for flight information messaging. </li>
                        <li>Modelling: developed a logical information model that integrates the ATM and UTM domains of operation, with significant changes to support drone operations and geo-spatial definition of routes. </li>
                        <li>Schema development: developed a physical data model representation of the Fly 2 Plan logical information model. Generation of message and storage schemas (JSON/XML) based on this data model. </li>
                        <li>DLT/Blockchain schema: developed the the JSON data model schema based on the information model used in the Fly 2 Plan distributed ledger for asset storage.</li>
                        <li>Update international standards: provided feedback to ACRIS to ensure the Fly 2 Plan model enhancements were incorporated back into the next update to the published <a href="https://acris.aero" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACRIS Semantic Model</a> as a benefit to the industry.</li>
                        <li>Hosting: provided a cloud based instance of the Fly 2 Plan information model to support collaborative development in the agile project development methodology used in Fly 2 Plan.</li>

                    <p>The distributed application developed by the Fly to Plan project team relies on <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyperledger Fabric</a> blockchain technology deployed using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes</a>. 
                    To lower the barrier to entry and make the solution more accessible, especially to smaller participants within the envisaged network, 
                    much of the technical complexity of Kubernetes and <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyperledger Fabric</a> blockchain needs to be relegated to the background. </p>

                    <p>The Hyperledger blockchain automation framework (BAF) was identified as meeting this objective using the automation tool Ansible 
                    to handle the cloud environment setup, blockchain network and chaincode deployment directed by a single master configuration file. 
                    During the course of the project, Hyperledger BAF evolved to become the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/bevel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyperledger Bevel</a> project. </p>

                    <p>Rockport Software provided technical expertise in the use of Kubernetes and Hyperledger Fabric deployment: </p>
                    <ul class="text-left">

                        <li>Rockport Software provisioned Hyperledger Fabric network test deployments of the Fly 2 Plan distributed application in cloud platforms provided by multiple cloud vendors using customized Hyperledger Blockchain Automation Framework scripts.</li>

                        <li>Rockport Software contributed code to Hyperledger BAF (initially a Hyperledger lab) to support the scripted deployment of a <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyperledger Fabric</a> network to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure's Kubernetes cluster offering, which was not already supported by Hyperledger BAF.
                            As the Hyperledger lab evolved into the full Hyperledger Bevel product, Rockport Software contributed code to this open source project and merged the new capabilities into the develop branch of the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyperledger Bevel source code</a> for future releases.</li>

                    The distributed nature of the blockchain solution developed during the Fly 2 Plan project provides a 
		 		    secure, scalable and trusted environment in which to exchange aviation information. 
		 		    A critical part of the Fly 2 Plan project was to assess the cybersecurity threat environment in which such an application would operate. 
		 		    Oxford University and Cranfield University focused on identifying cybersecurity threats and developing artificial intelligence algorithms that 
		 		    could be used to identify malicious activity within the distributed ledger network.
