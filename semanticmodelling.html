                    <p>A great deal of information is produced and consumed by many parties for every flight movement that occurs. 
                    Information is exchanged between business partners (B2B), between businesses and individuals (B2C) and between businesses and government agencies (B2G). 
                    
					From the airport perspective, the <Strong> ACI ACRIS (Aviation Community Recommended Information Services) </Strong> initiative was created to improve the quality of information being exchanged by providing standards such as industry, information and technology standards. 
					
					For the airline perspective, the <Strong> IATA Airline Industry Data Model (AIDM)</Strong>  provides a foundation for common information exchange between stakeholders involved in operating flights and providing passenger services. 
					
                    Standardising Aviation services facilitates integration and semantic inter-operability between aviation systems, whether in airport, 
                    airline, air traffic management, or third party vendors.

	                    <p>Airport business performance depends on seamless and meaningful information exchange. 
	                    Effective communication requires a common business vocabulary, with well defined terminology. </p>
						
	                    <p>This common vocabulary is the foundation of <strong>ACI’s Semantic Model</strong>. </p>
	                    
						<p>Knowledge is held about airlines, passengers, assets and other core factors in the Airport. 
	                    These business concepts represent the smallest grain of business knowledge. 
	                    The terms used to describe these concepts form the business vocabulary. 
	                    The Semantic Model defines the concepts, their characteristics, the relationships between them, and how they behave. 
	                    This provides a framework for semantic inter-operability within which different applications can cooperate with each other. 
	                    The applications may be within, or between, businesses e.g. an Airport sharing gate information with an Airline.</p>
	
	                    <p>The model contains four layers: the business language context layer, the knowledge layer, the data 
	                    element library of re-usable components, and the physical (technology) layer. 
	                    Information artefacts can be derived directly from the model. 
	                    These include for example, XSDs and JSON schemas, REST APIs and database scripts.</p>

                    <p>It has never been more important for an airport to base its decisions on trusted and reliable information. 
                    The ACRIS Semantic Model is a powerful tool to enable airports get easy access to timely and consistent information, 
                    both from internal and external sources. </p>

                    <p>In 2019, the United States Senate mandated that all US airports must provide travellers with 
                    consistent and comparable information on checkpoint wait times. </p>
                    <p>The ACRIS working group established the Passenger Queue Measurement project to develop an open API specification 
                    that could be used by airports worldwide, based on the ACRIS Semantic Model. </p>
                    <p>The wait times API integrates passenger queue wait times system interfaces from each airport to provide a 
                    single access point for information from all participating airports. </p>
                    <p>The use of the ACRIS Semantic Model ensures that the meaning and understanding of information sourced from 
                    multiple airports and system providers is consistent and comparable.</p>
